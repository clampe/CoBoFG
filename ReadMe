These folders contain supplementary calculations for Christoph Lampe's master thesis "On the Classification of Blocks of Finite Groups". They are divided into two folders named "GAP" and "MAGMA". As the names suggest the folder "GAP" contains calculations written in the programming language for GAP (http://www.gap-system.org), which is free software. Similarly the folder "MAGMA" contains calculations written in the programming language for MAGMA (http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/). MAGMA however is not free software, but at the time of this writing it is possible to run all of the given code here using their openly accessible online version at http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/calc. 

The programs were tested to run on:

- GAP version 4.8.7 released on 24th of March 2017
- MAGMA V2.23-2 released on 31st of July 2017
